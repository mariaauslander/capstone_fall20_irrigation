    "This notebook is used to preprocess the Sentinel2 images and irrigation labels extracted from Google Earth Engine using a modified version of the [Irrigation30 tool](https://github.com/AngelaWuGitHub/irrigation30) developed by a capstone team from Summer 2020. In order to minimize the number of files being written to Google Drive, predictions and images were gathered for areas of land that are large than what we want to use for training our model. The purpose therefore for this script is:\n",
    "1. Combine the separate multispectrum bands for each large image (12 channels)\n",
    "2. Split the MSI into non-overlapping subregions. \n",
    "3. Convert cluster numbers into irrigated/non-irrigated labels by month\n",
    "4. Create dataframe for each initial image. The dataframe will contain a row for every sub-image created along with the prediction array and some metadata.\n",
    "5. Serialize the dataframe as a pickle file"
